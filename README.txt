“I, Zaid Ali, with BlazerID zaidali completed this project on my own, with no external help or information except the official Javadocs, official class textbook, class lectures, instructor or TAs. I understand that any use of non-sanctioned materials (e.g., stack overflow, etc.)  is considered cheating and will result in a zero for this project, as well as reporting to the department, college, and university for further actions.”
